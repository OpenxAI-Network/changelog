On May 1, 2025, OpenxAI Network hosted SuperIntelligence 2049 at Dubai’s DAOs Hub during Token2049, co-organized with Fetch.ai, ASI Alliance, Aethir Cloud, SingularityNET, Daoshub, and 50xcap. The invite-only Crypto x AI summit showcased the transformative potential of decentralized AI, merging blockchain with autonomous intelligence to empower users, redistribute value, and challenge centralized platforms.

- Event Highlights:
  - Human Panel - “Decentralized Intelligence: Where Web3 Meets AGI”: Moderated by Gabriele Zennaro (50x Capital), the panel featured leaders including Humayun Sheikh (Fetch.ai), Mario Alberto Casiraghi (SingularityNET), Ashton Hettiarachi (OpenxAI), and Mark Rydon (Aethir). Discussions explored privacy, value redistribution, distributed AI economies, and community-driven innovation, emphasizing how OpenxAI’s infrastructure enables builders to capture value directly.
  - World’s First AI-Only Panel: Four autonomous AI personas - Tronald Pump, Bitter Schiff, Mickey Sailer, and Satoshi Mammoto - debated cryptocurrency and decentralization live, unscripted, powered by OpenxAI’s inference engine, XnodeOS, global bare metal servers, and Fetch.ai’s uAgents. The panel demonstrated fully autonomous, ideology-driven discourse, showcasing OpenxAI’s ability to deliver scalable, transparent, and engaging AI interactions.
  - Mimic Demo - Real-Time Voice AI: Attendees interacted with Mimic, a system capable of replicating voices in real-time using OpenxAI’s inference engine and Fetch.ai uAgents. The demo illustrated personalized, human-like AI interactions, highlighting decentralized, user-centric AI applications.
- Impact and Innovation:
  - OpenxAI’s technology enabled autonomous AI debate, ideological representation, and secure, scalable interactions.
  - The human panel underscored the redistribution of value in decentralized ecosystems, supporting privacy, sovereignty, and equitable AI-driven economies.
  - Partnerships amplified collaborative innovation, demonstrating the real-world applications of OpenxAI’s permissionless, decentralized infrastructure.

SuperIntelligence 2049 set a new benchmark for decentralized AI, highlighting OpenxAI’s leadership in building transparent, inclusive, and community-driven AI ecosystems. The event emphasized a future where AI empowers developers and users, reshaping industries through decentralized, autonomous, and ethical intelligence.
