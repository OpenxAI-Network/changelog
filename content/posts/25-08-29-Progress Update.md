- [Progress Update](https://medium.com/openxai/openxai-progress-update-on-august-29-2025-71eb6dca9a34)
- This week saw record hackathon engagement, major Studio upgrades, and stronger recognition of tokenized GPUs as a cornerstone of permissionless AI.
- Ecosystem Growth
  - India: Hacknode India became the largest Web3 hackathon to date, with 2,501 registrations, 343 submissions, and 388 pull requests. Workshops and bootcamps fueled momentum.
  - Australia & Global: Hacknodes were extended to increase participation, and the Hacknode Dashboard went live with links, submissions, and resources.
  - Offchain: Outreach expanded across 40 country channels. Local events and ambassadorships were prepared, with Luxembourg confirmed for October and strong interest from Rome, Turkey, and London.
- Engineering & Product
  - Studio v4.5: A new landing page with live stats was launched, demo servers scaled to 10, and responsiveness improved by disabling auto-gen in the chat app. Promo codes were integrated for GPU credits.
  - Studio v5: Development advanced with new transitions, homepage redesign, and improved responsiveness. Optimized animations were being prepared.
  - Base Mini App: The first Nixified demo app was deployed, showing how developers could host through the base app store.
- Narrative & Positioning
  - OpenxAI framed itself as defining permissionless AI. Tokenized GPUs (tGPUs) emerged as a leading application at the AI-DeFi intersection, enabling staking, fractionalization, and programmable GPU access.
- Community & Engagement
  - Ambassadors produced content simplifying GPU credits.
  - Micro-KOLs were activated for hacknode promotion.
  - A gamified Discord Academy was put in motion.
