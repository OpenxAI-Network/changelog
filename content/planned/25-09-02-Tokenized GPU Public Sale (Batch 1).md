- First Public Sale: OpenxAI will conduct its first-ever public sale of tokenized GPU credits (tGPUs), marking a milestone in making compute a liquid, on-chain resource.
- On-Chain Utility: Each tGPU will serve as an on-chain receipt, directly redeemable for real GPU workloads inside OpenxAI Studio.
- Proof of Demand: The batch will act as a market test, gauging demand for decentralized compute and validating early adopter interest.
- Liquidity Foundation: Proceeds from the sale will help seed liquidity for decentralized compute markets, forming a base layer for future scaling.
- Ecosystem Kickoff: By offering these credits publicly, the event will kickstart a cycle of usage, redemption, and secondary trading, laying groundwork for a broader decentralized GPU economy.
