- A handful of small but useful AI utilities will go live inside Base App, including a DeFi yield analyzer, NFT metadata summarizer, and a lightweight onchain scanner.
- The goal will be to show that AI utilities can be viral, composable, and fun when embedded into a consumer-facing L2.
- Early usage will provide data on what people actually want to use and share.
