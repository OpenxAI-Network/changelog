- The very first AI app will be showcased as a Farcaster Frame inside Base Feed.
- This is more than a technical milestone. It will demonstrate that AI can be embedded directly into the social UX people already use daily.
- Users will be able to interact in real time: trying the app, tipping the creator, or minting it without leaving the feed.
- The demo will be fun and engaging, sparking curiosity and conversation across the Base community.
