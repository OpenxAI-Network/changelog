One console, three chains.  
 Studio v6 introduces:

- Automatic chain selection: Deploy once and let Studio route workloads to the cheapest, fastest, or most suitable chain automatically, removing manual guesswork and optimizing costs.
- Multi-chain tokenization & monetization: Developers can issue tokens, set royalties, and enable subscriptions across Base, BNB, and Solana without writing chain-specific code.
- Unified analytics: Real-time dashboards aggregate app usage, revenue, and retention across all supported chains, making cross-chain performance benchmarking simple.
- From “chain-specific” to multi-chain AI economy: Instead of building silos, apps now participate in a fluid ecosystem where value, governance, and users flow freely across networks.
