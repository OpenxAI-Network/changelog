title: “Deploy & Share to Base” pipeline (Frames + Feed)

- A one-click workflow will let creators publish directly from Studio: deploy their AI app, mint it as an NFT, generate a Farcaster Frame, and instantly share it into the Base social feed.
- Users will be able to test-drive apps right in the feed, and if they like them, they can tip the creator or mint the app without leaving the interface.
- This update is designed to blur the line between building and distributing, so every deployed app immediately has a channel to reach an audience.
- By tying deployment to Base Feed, OpenxAI apps could gain viral traction faster, as social discovery and app usage happen in the same place.
- Creators who succeed in distribution will automatically build reputation through their Base Account identity, strengthening the ecosystem’s trust loop.
