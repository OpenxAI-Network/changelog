- Token Launch & Liquidity: The $OPENX token will launch with initial liquidity seeded on Aerodrome (Base) and Uniswap (Ethereum), ensuring users can trade and access the token from day one.
- Transparency Dashboard: A public vesting and unlock dashboard will go live, giving the community a clear way to track circulating supply, unlock schedules, and token distribution over time.
- Economic Backbone: The launch will establish $OPENX not as a short-term drop, but as the core currency of the protocol, designed to support payments, governance, and long-term alignment.
- Ecosystem Alignment: By introducing $OPENX, the project will create a shared foundation that aligns incentives across the protocolâ€™s contributors, partners, and users.
