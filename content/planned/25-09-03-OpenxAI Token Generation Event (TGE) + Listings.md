- Token Launch & Liquidity: The $OPENX token will launch on Base with initial liquidity seeded on Uniswap, ensuring users can trade and access the token from day one. More DEXes and chains will be added while the project evolves.
- Transparency Dashboard: A public vesting and unlock dashboard will go live, giving the community a clear way to track circulating supply, unlock schedules, and token distribution over time.
- Economic Backbone: The launch will establish $OPENX not as a short-term drop, but as the core currency of the protocol, designed to support payments, governance, and long-term alignment.
- Ecosystem Alignment: By introducing $OPENX, the project will create a shared foundation that aligns incentives across the protocol’s contributors, partners, and users.
