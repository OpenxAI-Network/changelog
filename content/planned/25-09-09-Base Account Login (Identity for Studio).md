- Base Account will serve as the default login layer for Studio. Creators will no longer need separate signups or third-party authentication; one wallet will function as their universal identity.
- This introduces the foundation of an on-chain reputation system, where accounts begin to build a portable record of usage, contributions, and performance across apps.
- Developers and partners can integrate this shared identity layer to design features like rating systems, creator badges, or trust scores without building their own solutions.
- Over time, this will help reduce spam and improve credibility across the ecosystem, since every action will be tied to a verifiable on-chain account.
