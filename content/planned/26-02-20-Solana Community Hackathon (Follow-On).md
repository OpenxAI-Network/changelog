We will run a second major Solana hackathon, building on the momentum from November.

- Advanced tracks include Blinks-based UX for frictionless AI interactions.
- On-chain DeFi analytics agents for real-time insights.
- DAO assistants to automate governance and proposal management.
- Starter templates and tGPU incentives provided to participants.
- Goal: at least 100 submissions with 20 apps graduating to production-ready status.
- This keeps developer engagement high and strengthens the Solana AI ecosystem.
