- This is the big production release: subscription payments, token-gated access, usage-based billing, and royalty splits go live across Base, BNB, and Solana.
- Each chain uses its own rails: Base Pay (USDC), BNB account abstraction, and Solana Pay.
- For creators, this is when OpenxAI starts to look like a business platform, not just an infra demo.
