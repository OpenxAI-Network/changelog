- Full SaaS economics deployed natively on BNB, combining subscription billing with tokenized infrastructure.
- Flexible billing options: recurring, usage-based, pay-per-call, and hybrid models.
- Pause/resume functionality ensures users only pay when theyâ€™re actively using services.
- Revenue dashboards give creators real-time insight into churn, growth cohorts, and monetization streams.
- Supports multi-party revenue splits, enabling marketplaces, collaborations, and ecosystem incentives.
- Subscription events feed directly into DAO analytics and treasury flows, aligning community governance with economic activity.
- Positions OpenxAI SaaS as the decentralized equivalent of Stripe + AWS, but fully programmable and permissionless.
