type: engineering

- Tokenization of AI models, datasets, and autonomous agents using ERC-721, ERC-6551, and ERC-2981 standards.
- Fractionalized ownership enabled through ERC-1155, allowing collaborative training, shared IP rights, and collective monetization.
- Royalty + licensing metadata embedded directly on-chain, ensuring creators earn seamlessly across both primary and secondary markets.
- Every tokenized asset is registered into the OpenxAI App Registry, making models composable and discoverable across the BNB ecosystem.
- Unlocks new primitives: AI marketplaces, agent leasing, data cooperatives, and community-owned AI networks.
- Establishes the foundation for “AI as an asset class”, bridging creator monetization, DeFi liquidity, and long-term DAO sustainability.
