- The keynote will mark a milestone moment for OpenxAI Ã— Base collaboration.
- Studio v5 will introduce app staking, tokenized model minting, mini-app deployment, and integration with the Farcaster Feed.
- For the first time, creators will be able to take a model through the full lifecycle: mint it, stake it, deploy it as an app, and monetize it without leaving the ecosystem.
- The launch will highlight real use cases by showcasing early creator apps built and deployed directly through Studio v5.
- A live demo will walk through the entire workflow end-to-end to show how seamless and accessible the stack has become.
- The event will be positioned as both a product launch and a community rallying point, signaling readiness for mainstream adoption.
