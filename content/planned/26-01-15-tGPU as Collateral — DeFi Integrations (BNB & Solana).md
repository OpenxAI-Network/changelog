Weâ€™re turning compute into collateral.

- Venus (BNB) and Marginfi/Kamino (Solana) integrate tGPU credits as borrowable assets.
- Oracle feeds + risk parameters govern safe usage.
- GPU-backed yield vaults launch, distributing OPENX + native token rewards.
- Goal: make compute a recognized financial primitive across chains.
