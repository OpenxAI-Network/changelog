- Native $OPENX contracts will be deployed on BNB Chain with mirrored reward and emissions logic from Base.
- BNB users can stake, govern, and earn directly without external bridging friction.
- This establishes $OPENX as a multi-chain token and sets the groundwork for future liquidity and ecosystem expansion.
