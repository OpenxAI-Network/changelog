- Support for compressed NFTs (cNFTs) for cheap mass-minting of AI agents.
- Programmable NFTs (pNFTs) for ownership logic and royalty rules.
- These standards allow AI apps to be issued and traded in a way that feels natural to Solanaâ€™s NFT culture.
- Goal: low-cost, high-throughput issuance of AI assets that can scale to millions.
