- A new initiative where selected developers rotate across Base, BNB, and Solana ecosystems, building multi-chain apps with shared mentoring.
- This will seed cross-pollination: Solana NFT devs testing AI monetization, BNB DeFi devs experimenting with compute yield, Base social builders leveraging Frames.
- The aim is to break echo chambers and grow hybrid teams.
